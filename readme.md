# autochecker

autochecker helps you test your JavaScript modules in many different versions of NodeJS, rapidly and without thinking about it.

Works well with CI as well!

![Demonstration of functionality](./demo.gif)

## Requirements

* Docker
* `package.json` `scripts.test` setup correctly
* Two environment variables, `DOCKER_HOST` and `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` (comes by default with docker-machine)

`DOCKER_HOST` should look similar to this: `tcp://192.168.99.100:2376`
`DOCKER_CERT_PATH` should look similar to this: `/Users/victor/.docker/machine/machines/default`

## Installation

As always, one step:

* For one project > `npm install autochecker`

* Globally on your computer > `npm install -g autochecker`

For extra style points, make sure autochecker is run before publishing your modules:

In `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
	"prepublish": "autochecker 0.10 0.12 4.0 5.0"
}
```
