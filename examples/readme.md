## autochecker examples

This is a collection of examples on how to run autochecker with different languages and configurations

Typically, a example looks like this:

```
directory >
| autochecker.sh # for running autochecker 
| DockerTemplate # for telling autochecker how to build
\ source_code # the rest of the files for language/configuration that is needed
```

## To run all of them:

`./run_all_examples.sh`
