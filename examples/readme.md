## autochecker examples

This is a collection of examples on how to run autochecker with different languages and configurations

Typically, a example looks like this:

directory >
| autochecker.sh # for running autochecker 
| DockerTemplate # for telling autochecker how to build
\ source_code # files for language/configuration that is needed

## To run all of them:

`./run_all_examples.sh`
